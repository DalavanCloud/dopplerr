Subtitle Download Web Service for Sonarr or Radarr. It can automatically search for subtitles when
the file has been successfully downloaded.

* Free software: MIT
* Source: https://github.com/Stibbons/subdlsrv
* Python 3. Python 2 is tested by Travis but local installation is not provided.


## Usage

The best usage is through the docker image.

### Use with Docker

Use my docker image:

```
docker create \
	--name subdlsrv \
	-p 8000:8000 \
	-e PUID=<UID> -e PGID=<GID> \
    -v <path/to/animes>:/animes \
	-v <path/to/movies>:/movies \
    -v <path/to/tvseries>:/tv \
	stibbons31/subdlsrv
```

Mount your media directory in `/media`. This directory exists in the docker image, so if you have
several media directory (`/series`, `/tv`, `/animes`), mount them all in `/media` and set the
following environment variable: `SUBDLSRC_BASEDIR=/media`.

It is a good practive to run Sonarr and Radarr in their own container, so they also "see" their
media in `/series`, `/tv`, `/animes`. They will communicate these path to subdlsrv. Base directory
(`SUBDLSRC_BASEDIR`) can be used to put all these folder in same directory. If `SUBDLSRC_BASEDIR` is
not defined, subdlsrv will assume the path communicated by Sonarr or Radarr also exists locally. So
mouth your series folder to `/series`, TV show folder to `/tv`, and animes to `/animes` and so  on.

#### Parameters

The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side. For example with a port -p external:internal - what this shows is the port mapping from internal to external of the container. So -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080 http://192.168.x.x:8080 would show you what's running INSIDE the container on port 80.


- `-p 8000` - the port webinterface
- `-v /anime` - location of Anime library on disk
- `-v /movies` - location of Movies library on disk
- `-v /tv` - location of TV library on disk
- `-e PGID for for GroupID` - see below for explanation
- `-e PUID for for UserID` - see below for explanation
- `-e SUBDLSRC_BASEDIR` - set media base directory (optional)

#### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (-v flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and
the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user PUID and group PGID. Ensure
the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work"
TM.

In this instance PUID=1001 and PGID=1001. To find yours use id user as below:

  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)


### Local installation:

Create a dedicated virtual environment and install it properly with the following commands:

```
sudo ./bootstrap.sh
./install.sh prod
```

This will install subdlsrv in a local virtual environment will all its dependencies without messing
with your system's Python environment.

### Installing in your system

Do NOT install a Python application in your system. Use Virtualenv. Or let it do by your
distribution's maintainer.

### Radarr/Sonarr Configuration

Configure a webhook:

- **On Download/On Upgrade**

## Contributing

Bootstrap your system with
```
sudo ./bootstrap.sh
```

Setup your environment with
```
./install.sh
```

Test with:
```
./test-local.sh
```

or run it live with
```
./dev.sh
```

Activate the environment (to start your editor from, for example):

```
$ pipenv shell
```

## Publishing

(This part should be automatically done by Travis)

Build Wheel package:

```
pipenv run python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

Register and publish your package to Pypi:

```
pipenv run python setup.py sdist register upload
```

Create a release: create a tag with a semver syntax. Optionally you can tag code locally and push
to GitHub.

```
git tag 1.2.3
```

On successful travis build on the Tag branch, your Pypi package will be automatically updated.
